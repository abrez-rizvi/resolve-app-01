Scoring and Interpretation (The Metrics)
After the user answers all the questions, the app calculates their total score to determine their PDI.
Total Possible Score: 26 points
PDI Levels:
Low Dependability (Score: 0-6)
Interpretation: Your usage appears to be controlled and is likely not causing significant issues in your life. You may be here for curiosity or to build healthier habits.
App Action: The app can recommend foundational content on mindful internet use, goal setting, and channel-switching techniques. The approach can be less intensive.
Moderate Dependability (Score: 7-13)
Interpretation: Your habit is becoming more established. You may be feeling a loss of control and experiencing some negative consequences. This is a crucial stage to build awareness and new coping mechanisms.
App Action: The app should suggest a structured program, introduce CBT exercises for identifying triggers, and strongly encourage using the "Urge Log" and "Community" features.
High Dependability (Score: 14-20)
Interpretation: Your pornography use is likely a primary coping mechanism and is having a clear, negative impact on your life. The behavior may feel compulsive and difficult to manage on your own.
App Action: The app should immediately recommend a more intensive, structured daily plan. It should prioritize features like accountability partners, emergency "parachute" options, and advanced content on neuroscience and recovery. It could also provide resources for finding a therapist.
Severe Dependability (Score: 21-26)
Interpretation: Your relationship with pornography is causing significant distress and disruption. The behavior is likely compulsive, and you may feel powerless to stop. Professional help is strongly recommended.
App Action: The app should present its most robust features immediately. The tone should be highly supportive but firm. Most importantly, it should prominently display resources for professional help, such as links to therapists specializing in addiction, support groups (like SAA), and mental health hotlines. The app serves as a powerful tool, but it should encourage professional guidance at this level.
