Example Result:

"Thanks for sharing! Hereâ€™s a look at your personal trigger profile:"

Your Primary Emotional Trigger is: Boredom.

What this means: You use scrolling to fill empty moments. The key is to have alternatives ready before boredom strikes.

Actionable Tip: Create a "Boredom-Buster" list. Write down 5 things you can do in under 5 minutes (e.g., stretch, tidy one surface, listen to one song, step outside). Keep it visible.

Your Primary Environmental Trigger is: Just Seeing Your Phone.

What this means: The mere presence of your phone is a powerful visual cue. "Out of sight, out of mind" is your best strategy.

Actionable Tip: When you need to focus, place your phone in a drawer or another room. Set a specific time to check it, rather than letting it call to you.

Your Primary Time-Based Trigger is: Late at Night.

What this means: You've built a strong habit of scrolling before bed, which can harm your sleep quality.

Actionable Tip: Charge your phone across the room, not on your nightstand. Try reading a physical book for 10 minutes before bed instead.
